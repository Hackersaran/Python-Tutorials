## Python Operators

print(200+63)

'''

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

'''

## Python Arithmetic Operators

print(10+12)
print(10-12)
print(10/12)
print(10*12)
print(10%12)
print(10**12)
print(10//12)

## Python Assignment Operators

x = 5	         #x = 5	
x += 3	         #x = x + 3	
x -= 3	         #x = x - 3	
x *= 3	         #x = x * 3	
x /= 3	         #x = x / 3	
x %= 3	         #x = x % 3	
x //= 3	         #x = x // 3	
x **= 3	         #x = x ** 3	
x &= 3	         #x = x & 3	
x |= 3	         #x = x | 3	
x ^= 3	         #x = x ^ 3	
x >>= 3	         #x = x >> 3	
x <<= 3	         #x = x << 3

## Python Comparison Operators

x == x              
x != x
x > x	
x < x	
x >= x
x <= x

## Python Logical Operators

x < 5 and  x < 10                            # and
x < 5 or x < 4                               # or
not(x < 5 and x < 10)                        # not

## Python Identity Operators

x is x                                       # is
x is not x                                   # is not

## Python Membership Operators

x in x                                       # in
x not in x                                   # not in

## Python Bitwise Operators

'''

x & 12
x | 12
x^100
x ~ x
x<<12
12>>x

'''
